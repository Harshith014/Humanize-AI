# Humanize AI

**Humanize AI** is a simple and effective web tool that transforms AI-generated text into a more natural, human-like format. This project was built using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, making it lightweight and easy to use.

## Key Features

- **Text Input**: Enter any AI-generated text into the designated input field.
  
- **Bypass AI Button**: Click this button to generate a humanized version of your input text. The result will be displayed in a separate output field.

- **Sample Text**: Use the **"Try a Sample"** button to quickly populate the input field with a pre-defined sample text:
  - **Sample Text**: "This is a sample text to demonstrate the humanization process."

- **Paste Text**: The **"Paste Text"** button allows you to paste any copied text into the input field for immediate transformation.

- **Copy Output**: After generating the humanized text, you can click the **"Copy Output"** button to copy the result to your clipboard. An alert will confirm that the text has been copied successfully.

## How It Works

1. **Input Your Text**: Begin by entering or pasting AI-generated text into the input field.
  
2. **Transform Your Text**: Click the **"Bypass AI"** button to convert your text into a humanized format.

3. **Use Sample Text**: If you want to see how it works, click the **"Try a Sample"** button to load a sample text automatically.

4. **Copy and Share**: After processing, click the **"Copy Output"** button to easily share the humanized text. A confirmation alert will let you know it's been copied.
